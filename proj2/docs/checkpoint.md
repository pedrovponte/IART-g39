##Checkpoint

Each group must submit in Moodle a brief presentation (max. 5 slides), in PDF format, which will be used in the class to analyze, together with the teacher, the progress of the work. The presentation should contain: 
- **specification** of the work to be performed (definition of the machine learning problem to address); 
-  **related work** with references to works found in a bibliographic search (articles, web pages and/or source code); 
- description of the **tools and algorithms** to use in the assignment; 
- **implementation** work already carried out.
  
-> An initial exploratory data analysis should be carried out (class distribution, values per attribute, and so on)

###**Steps:**
- dataset analysis to check for the need for data pre-processing
- identification of the target concept
- definition of the training and test sets
- selection and parameterization of the learning algorithms to employ
- evaluation of the learning process

####Supervised learning algorithms:
 - Decision Trees, Neural Networks, K-NN, SVM
